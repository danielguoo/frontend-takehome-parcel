# Teachable Frontend Takehome

### Technologies Used

* Frontend framework: React
* Testing: Jest, Enzyme
* Package Manager: Yarn
* External libraries:
  * Icons: react-icons
  * Loading: react-loading

### Next Steps
* I stuck with vanilla React because the project was small enough, but if the scale expanded I would consider using Redux and Typescript for maintainability purposes.
* Support pagination for when the search call returns more than 30 results. This could also be used when there are more than 30 saved gems.
* Spice up the UI a little bit- in the interest of time I prioritized test coverage instead.
